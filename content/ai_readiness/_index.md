description: "Tools by how consumable their output is for LLM-based workflows"
---

Each tool is classified by how easily its archived output
can be consumed by LLM-based workflows -- from structured JSON
that an AI can use directly, through partially structured output
needing some processing, to binary/media content requiring
transcription or OCR.
See [AI Readiness Levels](/about/#ai-readiness-levels) for full definitions.
