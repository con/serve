[TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) is the standard tabular format
in both BIDS (`participants.tsv`, events files) and the con/serve vault
(hierarchical summary tables like `channels.tsv`, `videos.tsv`).
Lightweight, diffable in git, and directly queryable by DuckDB, VisiData, and Pandas.
