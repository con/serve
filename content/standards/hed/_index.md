[HED](https://www.hedtags.org/) (Hierarchical Event Descriptors)
provides a standardized, machine-readable vocabulary and syntax
for describing events in experiments.
Composable tags, supported natively by BIDS events files,
and central to the [Annotation Garden]({{< ref "annotation-garden" >}}) initiative.
