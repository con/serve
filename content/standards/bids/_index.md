[BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/) (Brain Imaging Data Structure)
defines directory layouts, naming conventions, and JSON sidecar metadata
for neuroimaging datasets. Increasingly extended to other modalities
(EEG, MEG, PET, microscopy, stimuli via Stim-BIDS).
The entity-labeled path structure (`sub-01/ses-01/func/`) is a key influence
on vault organization patterns.
