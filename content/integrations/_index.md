description: "Tools by depth of git-annex/DataLad integration"
---

Each tool is classified by how deeply it integrates with
the git-annex/DataLad stack -- from native DataLad extensions
that produce datasets directly, through git-annex and git-only tools,
to external tools whose output must be imported manually.
See [Integration Levels](/about/#integration-levels) for full definitions.
