The [Tools](/tools/) section catalogs what exists.
The [Concepts](/concepts/) section describes how the pieces fit together.
This section describes **why** -- the concrete scenarios
that motivate the development of tools, connectors, and workflows.

Each user story represents a real archival goal
that a person or research group would pursue.
Stories identify the data sources, the desired end state,
the tools involved, and the gaps that need to be filled.
